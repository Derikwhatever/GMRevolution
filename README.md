An adaptation of callmeEthan's Gamemaker_quaternion library that makes it compatible and more convenient to use with DragoniteSpam's Vector3 library.

I've also added myself some extra handy functions to expand the usefulness of the library.

Something to note is it expects all of DragoniteSpam's Vector3 functions to be shortened to vec3 which you will also need to do to use it with this, or change any vec3 to a Vector3, either way.
