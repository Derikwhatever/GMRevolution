An easy-to-use and convenient library that contains structs and handy functions such as vectors, quaternions, and various other function related to their use.

Originally started out as only an adaptation of callmeEthan's Gamemaker_quaternion library that made it compatible and more convenient to use with DragoniteSpam's Vector3 library, but I have since made additions to this libraries and modified them for use in my own projects.
